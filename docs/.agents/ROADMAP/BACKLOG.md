# Backlog

> Groomed list of future work not yet active. Active work lives in [`../ACTIVE_WORK.md`](../ACTIVE_WORK.md);
> the single next item in [`../NEXT_TASK.md`](../NEXT_TASK.md). Ordered by priority.

**As of:** 2026-06-07

## P0 — Gating

1. ~~**Stabilize + commit the in-flight working tree.**~~ ✅ Complete (commit landed).
2. ~~**First foreign-provider validation.**~~ ✅ **Kokoro G5 passed** (real audio generated
   E2E through the Runtime). Cloud readiness gate is **OPEN**.
3. ~~**ADR-0017 (Phase 2 implementation architecture).**~~ ✅ **Accepted** 2026-06-07.
   See [ADR-0017](../DECISIONS/adr-0017-runtime-services-implementation.md) and
   [`../SPECS/FEATURES/runtime-services-implementation/`](../SPECS/FEATURES/runtime-services-implementation/).
   Architecture review: 0 blocking issues. Non-blocking suggestions applied
   (Runtime Persistence → `OPEN_DECISIONS.md` Decision 12).
4. **Runtime-Service migration — Phase 2 Sub-phase 2A (Foundations).** TDD-shaped
   tasks in
   [`../SPECS/FEATURES/runtime-services-implementation/TASKS.md`](../SPECS/FEATURES/runtime-services-implementation/TASKS.md) §2A.
   First P0 work item: `RuntimeDescriptor`, `RuntimeInstance`, `HealthReport`/`Metrics`,
   `RuntimeDriverError`, `RuntimeDriver` Protocol, `RuntimeRegistryLoader`,
   `RuntimeEventBus`, `RuntimeManager` skeleton, status updates,
   `PeakVoxRuntime` integration.
5. **Runtime-Service migration — Sub-phases 2B, 2C, 2D** (Docker driver; HTTPTransport +
   Kokoro integration; CE operations). Sequenced behind 2A.
6. **Runtime-Service migration — Phases 3–7** (Kokoro, F5-TTS, Fish, OmniVoice migrations,
   in-process path removal). Sequenced behind Phase 2.

## P1 — CE hardening (can proceed in parallel with Phase 2)

6. **Phase 9 — Public API harden:** freeze `/v1`, consistent error model (402/409/410/422),
   `pv_` key transition, publish OpenAPI, ship SDK, deprecation policy.
7. **OmniVoice end-to-end audio test** (gated/optional CI lane with weights) to move OmniVoice
   from PARTIAL to VALIDATED on the provider axis.
8. **Fish S2 Pro server deployment** (subject to existing hardware blocker — 24GB+ VRAM
   required; see
   [`../VALIDATION/PROVIDER_VALIDATIONS/`](../VALIDATION/PROVIDER_VALIDATIONS/)).
9. **Kokoro G7 (performance) and G8 (error recovery)** measurement — low priority.

## P2 — Provisioning decisions (write the reserved ADRs when decided)

10. ADR-0012 Variant Provisioning Policies (per Creation Source).
11. ADR-0013 Model Categories (cloning vs preset vs training).
12. **Future driver ADRs:** `KubernetesRuntimeDriver` (Cloud), `PodmanRuntimeDriver`,
    `LocalProcessDriver` (one ADR per driver when its edition begins; see
    [`../OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](../OPEN_DECISIONS.md) Decision 11).
13. **Runtime Persistence ADR** (see
    [`../OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](../OPEN_DECISIONS.md) Decision 12). Non-blocking.
    Future work for fleet management, operational dashboards, historical
    health tracking, Cloud orchestration, runtime metrics.

## P3 — Cloud ecosystem (no longer blocked on P0.2; sequencing is now deliberate)

13. Phase 4 Auth (Clerk adapter + principal resolution + roles).
14. Phase 5 Billing (credits ledger + metering + Stripe).
15. Phase 6 Creators (profiles + Connect + royalties).
16. Phase 7 Marketplace (listings + discovery + royalty-on-use).
17. Phase 8 Cloud Infra (Postgres + Alembic + worker pool + CDN + observability).
18. Phase 10 Production Scaling.

> Cloud phases are no longer blocked by the provider-validation gate, but
> investment in them before Runtime-Service Phase 2 lands would re-couple backend
> to model execution. **Phase 2 first, then deliberate Cloud sequencing.**
